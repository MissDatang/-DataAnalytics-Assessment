### Q1: High-Value Customers with Multiple Products

# Objective: 
Identify customers who have both at least one funded savings plan and one funded investment plan, and rank them by total deposits.

# Approach:
1. Joined `users_customuser`, `plans_plan`, and `savings_savingsaccount` tables.
2. Used `is_regular_savings = 1` to identify savings plans and `is_a_fund = 1` for investment plans.
3. Used `CASE WHEN` inside `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` to count each type per customer.
4. Summed `confirmed_amount` (converted from kobo to naira).
5. Applied a `HAVING` filter to return only customers with at least one of each plan type.

## Challenges and How I Resolved Them

# Challenge 
The `name` field in `users_customuser` was `NULL` for all rows.  

# Solution: 
Used `CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)` to create full names.
